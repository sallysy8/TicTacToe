# TicTacToe


2 players are able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer).

The board printed out every time a player makes a move.

The program accepts input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board.

Finally, it will show who win the game.

For further development, we can enlarge the board to 9*9 or even larger.
